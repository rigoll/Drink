### Installation and Setup Instructions
This is an incomplete project so there is nothing to instobstaclesall but I do have a .java file that runs the program outside of the compiler.


### Reflection
This project is by far the best teacher anyone could have. This project came to be because I had pumps and a Rpi laying around besides it sounded like a cool idea and a way to learn more Java. The main obstacles for me was my knowledge of Java. As a software tester my main proficency with code i simply to read it and figure out what it does. Worjing out how to manipulate to Rpi input-output pins was the easy part, implementing and coding UI and connecting it to a tocuh screen was quite the hassle for me but I made it work.
